# Automated POI Generation Pipeline (GIS + NLP)

##  Overview
This project was completed during a one-year internship focused on building a pipeline for the automated generation of Point of Interest (POI) data. Leveraging GIS techniques, SQL, and natural language processing, the system aimed to significantly enhance geospatial data production efficiency within the company.

##  Objective
To design and implement a scalable, semi-automated workflow that converts unstructured or ambiguous address descriptions into structured POI data through deep learning-based geocoding and semantic matching.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **GIS Tools**: Internal geospatial platforms and data APIs
- **Programming**: Python (for scripting and process automation)
- **Databases**: SQL (data querying, transformation)
- **NLP**: Used for semantic analysis and address standardization
- **Design Artifacts**: Process flowcharts, system architecture, documentation

##  My Role
- Led the initial workflow design and system architecture planning.
- Created data flow specifications and modular task definitions for each processing stage.
- Assisted in prototype development and testing of the geocoding module.
- Evaluated pipeline performance and proposed optimization strategies.
- Documented the full design process in a detailed technical specification.

##  Outcome
- The pipeline was successfully deployed and integrated into the companyâ€™s internal POI production environment.
- Resulted in an estimated **50% improvement in data generation efficiency**.
- Demonstrated the impact of combining domain-specific NLP and GIS in industrial data workflows.

##  Note on Confidentiality
Due to NDA and corporate confidentiality, no source code or raw data is published in this repository. Only non-sensitive design concepts and high-level summaries are included.

##  Status
Project documentation and design materials will be uploaded after data retrieval from previous device.
